# obj-games
obj-games is a set of games written using object oriented Python. <br>
The goal was use the standard Python library (Python3.4) to better understand the language and concepts in object oriented programming. The interface is very simplistic/barebones (1980s) and needs to be run in the Python interpreter. 

To run obj-games follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>In the directory of games start python or ipython</li>
<li>At the prompt (>>>): run handler.py</li>
<li>Instantiate the game handler: >>> game = GameHandler()</li>
<li>Initialize the game handler: >>> game.initialize_game()</li>
</ol>
From here there will be directions to pick a game of interest. For now there is TicTacToe, Battleship and Minesweeper.
